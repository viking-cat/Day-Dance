# DAY DANCE
Service based life organizer

Some electro swing music was playing in my headphones and became the inspiration for the name. Life has a rhytm just like music. Things go fast, thing slow down and you are trying to dance through the day.

This is easier for some than others. This is intended for myself and my hope is to create something that allows me to dance through the day without exhausting myself.
